STEP 1:First we install system-wide support for Python virtual environments and other dependencies. Actual Python packages are installed later.
sudo apt-get install git python3-virtualenv libssl-dev libffi-dev build-essential libpython3-dev python3-minimal authbind virtualenv Python3.11.0 venv.

STEP 2: It’s strongly recommended to run with a dedicated non-root user id:
$ sudo adduser --disabled-password cowrie
Adding user 'cowrie' ...
Adding new group 'cowrie' (1002) ...
Adding new user 'cowrie' (1002) with group 'cowrie' ...
Changing the user information for cowrie
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
Full Name []:
Room Number []:
Work Phone []:
Home Phone []:
Other []:
Is the information correct? [Y/n]
$ sudo su – cowrie

STEP 3: Cloning Repository From The Webpage:

$ cd cowrie

STEP 4: Next you need to create your virtual environment:
$ pwd
/home/cowrie/cowrie
$ python -m venv cowrie-env
New python executable in ./cowrie/cowrie-env/bin/python
Installing setuptools, pip, wheel...done.

STEP 5: Activate the virtual environment and install packages:
$ source cowrie-env/bin/activate
(cowrie-env) $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip
(cowrie-env) $ python -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

STEP 6: The configuration for Cowrie is stored in cowrie.cfg.dist and cowrie.cfg (Located in cowrie/etc). Both files are read on startup, where entries from cowrie.cfg take precedence. The .dist file can be overwritten by upgrades, cowrie.cfg will not be touched. To run with a standard configuration, there is no need to change anything. To enable telnet, for example, create cowrie.cfg and input only the following:
[telnet]
enabled = true

STEP 7: Start Cowrie with the cowrie command. You can add the cowrie/bin directory to your path if desired. An existing virtual environment is preserved if activated, otherwise Cowrie will attempt to load the environment called “cowrie-env”:
$ bin/cowrie start
Activating virtualenv "cowrie-env"
Starting cowrie with extra arguments [] ...
